## ðŸ“‹ How It Works

```
Azure Monitor Alert Fires
        â†“
Cynteo Alert Bridge (Logic App)
        â†“
SolarWinds Service Desk Incident Created
```

When an alert fires:
1. Azure Monitor sends webhook to Alert Bridge
2. Alert Bridge checks if ticket already exists for this alert
3. Creates new incident OR updates existing incident
4. When alert resolves, incident is automatically marked as resolved
